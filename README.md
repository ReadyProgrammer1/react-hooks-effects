React 16.7.0-alpha Using the new Hooks API

With the new useState() hook there will be less need to define classes only in order to use this.setState(). 

With the new useEffect() hook there will be less need to define separate life-cycle methods as the effect will be consistent throughout the life-cycle render (via updates, etc.)
